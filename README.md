# Image and Container Vulnerability CSV creation

This is an example script on creating two CSV files from the Qualys Container Security API for both images and containers respectively.

*Info* : Python script creates CSV files for vulnerability data from Qualys Cloud Security w.r.t details provided in `./config.yml`.
       Script debug info will be logged in ./debug/debug_file.txt

CSV File Info
*Vulnerability Image Report headers*
> Registry,Repository,ImageID,Tag,Hostname,Vulnerabiltiy ID,Severity,CVE Number,Published Date,Description,Patch Available

*Vulnerability Container Report headers*
>Registry,Repository,ImageID,Tag,Container,Hostname,Vulnerabiltiy ID,Severity,CVE Number,Published Date,Description,Patch Available

## Configuration
Two configuration settings will need to be made by the user before using this script: Updating the config.yml with appropriate information, and setting API username and password in environment variables.

*config.yml* provides script configuration information for vulnerability severity ratings and Qualys API URL

  `vulnerabilities_to_report`: string value of severity ratings to include (**acceptable entries 54321, 5432, 543, 54, or 5**)

  `apiURL`: Qualys API URL base (https:// - > .com, without a trailing '/'. e.g. `https://qualysapi.qg2.apps.qualys.com` )

### Qualys API Username and Password
This script is configured to read the Qualys User name and Password from OS Environment Variables:
  `QUALYS_API_USERNAME`: Qualys API Username

  `QUALYS_API_PASSWORD`: Qualys API Password

These can be set on a mac/linux system with commands such as:
```
export QUALYS_API_USERNAME=frank
export QUALYS_API_USERNAME=frankspassword
```

*note*: We recommend you consider rammifications of leaving credentials in environment variables or shell history. Potential improvements to this script would include reading these credentials from more secure locations.

## Script Requirements
This script is tested on Python 3.

This script requires the following PIP modules to run:
  sys, requests, datetime, os, time, pyyaml, json, base64

### Example Python module install
MAC/Linux:
```
pip install requests
```
Windows:
```
python -m pip install requests
```

## Debug
Debug file for script run, located in `debug` folder with time/date stamp per line. To disable debug, comment out all lines containing `debug` in the script.
